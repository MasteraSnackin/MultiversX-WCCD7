Project Overview
This smart contract is designed to manage token issuance on the MultiversX blockchain. It tracks the number of tokens each account has issued and provides a view endpoint for querying this information.

Features
Token Issuance: Allows users to issue tokens.
Token Balance Tracking: Keeps track of the balance of each token within the contract.
Query Endpoint: Users can query the number of tokens issued by any account.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Rust and Cargo: Install Rust
MultiversX Rust SDK: Follow the MultiversX setup guide
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_multiversx_contract.git
cd my_multiversx_contract
Build the Project
Compile the smart contract to WebAssembly (Wasm):

bash
Copy
cargo build --release
Usage
Issue Tokens
To issue tokens, call the issue_tokens endpoint with the desired token_id and amount.

Query Issued Tokens
To query the number of tokens an account has issued, use the query_issued_tokens view endpoint.

Testing
Run integration tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected:

bash
Copy
cargo test
